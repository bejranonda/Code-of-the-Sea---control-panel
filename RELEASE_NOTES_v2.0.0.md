## 🔄 Breaking Changes & Migration

### **Service Management Changes**

**IMPORTANT:** Service management has completely changed in v2.0.0.

#### **Old Method (v1.x) - DEPRECATED**
```bash
# These methods no longer work reliably
python3 radio/fm-radio_menu.py &
python3 mixing/mixing_menu.py &
# Manual process management required
```

#### **New Method (v2.0) - RECOMMENDED**
```bash
# Simple, reliable service management
./services start           # All services
./services restart radio   # Individual services
./services status          # Health monitoring
```

### **Configuration Updates**

Some configuration parameters have been enhanced:

```json
{
  "Radio Service": {
    "mode": "Loop",
    "loop_duration": "30",
    "mode_selector": "Loop"
  },
  "Mixing Service": {
    "mode": "Auto",
    "device_detection": "enhanced"
  }
}
```
