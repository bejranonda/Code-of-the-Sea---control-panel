# üîÑ Migration Guide: v1.x ‚Üí v2.0.0

This guide helps you safely migrate from Code of the Sea v1.x to v2.0.0 with minimal downtime and zero data loss.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Pre-Migration Checklist**

**IMPORTANT**: v2.0.0 introduces breaking changes in service management. Please follow this guide carefully.

- [ ] **Backup Configuration**: Save current settings
- [ ] **Document Running Services**: Note which services are currently active
- [ ] **Test Environment**: If possible, test migration on a non-production system first
- [ ] **Schedule Downtime**: Plan for brief service interruption during migration
- [ ] **Verify Hardware**: Ensure all connected devices are functioning

- **Enhanced**: `mixing/` service completely rewritten

---

## üöÄ **Migration Steps**

### **Step 1: Backup Current System**

```bash
# Create backup directory
mkdir -p ~/cos_v1_backup/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
cd ~/cos_v1_backup/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Backup configuration files
cp /home/payas/cos/unified_config.json .
cp /home/payas/cos/service_config.json .
cp -r /home/payas/cos/*/status.json . 2>/dev/null || true
cp -r /home/payas/cos/*/config.json . 2>/dev/null || true

# Backup logs
cp -r /home/payas/cos/logs/ . 2>/dev/null || true

# Document current running processes
ps aux | grep -E "(menu\.py|python.*cos)" | grep -v grep > running_processes.txt

echo "‚úÖ Backup completed in: $(pwd)"
```

### **Step 2: Stop All v1.x Services**

```bash
# Stop systemd service if running
sudo systemctl stop cos-control-panel 2>/dev/null || true
sudo systemctl disable cos-control-panel 2>/dev/null || true

# Stop all Python services
pkill -f "menu.py" || true
pkill -f "unified_app.py" || true

# Wait for services to stop
sleep 5

# Verify all stopped
echo "Checking for remaining processes..."
ps aux | grep -E "(menu\.py|unified_app\.py)" | grep -v grep || echo "‚úÖ All services stopped"
```

### **Step 3: Update to v2.0.0**

```bash
cd /home/payas/cos

# Stash any local changes
git stash push -m "Pre-v2.0.0 migration backup"

# Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin

# Update to v2.0.0
git checkout v2.0.0

# Verify version
cat VERSION  # Should show: 2.0.0

echo "‚úÖ Updated to Code of the Sea v2.0.0"
```

### **Step 4: Install New Service Management**

```bash
# Make service scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
chmod +x services

# Verify service scripts are ready
ls -la scripts/manage_*_service.sh
ls -la services

echo "‚úÖ Service management scripts installed"
```

### **Step 5: Migrate Configuration**

```bash
# The v2.0.0 system will automatically detect and migrate most settings
# Manual verification recommended:

# Check unified_config.json for new parameters
echo "Current configuration:"
cat unified_config.json

# Add any missing v2.0 parameters if needed
# Most configurations will be auto-migrated on first run
```

### **Step 6: Start Services with New System**

```bash
# Start all services with new management system
./services start

# Wait for services to initialize
sleep 10

# Verify all services are running
./services status

echo "‚úÖ Services started with v2.0.0 management system"
```

### **Step 7: Verification**

```bash
# Test each service
echo "üîç Testing services..."

# Test audio recording
echo "Testing microphone recording..."
timeout 30 ./services status | grep -i mixing || echo "Mixing service check needed"

# Test radio functionality
echo "Testing radio service..."
timeout 30 ./services status | grep -i radio || echo "Radio service check needed"

# Test web interface
echo "Testing web interface..."
curl -s http://localhost:5000 >/dev/null && echo "‚úÖ Web interface accessible" || echo "‚ùå Web interface check needed"

# Check for any errors
echo "Checking for service errors..."
./services status | grep -i error || echo "‚úÖ No errors detected"
```

## üîß **Post-Migration Tasks**

### **Update System Service (if applicable)**

If you were using systemd service:

```bash
# Remove old service
sudo systemctl stop cos-control-panel 2>/dev/null || true
sudo rm -f /etc/systemd/system/cos-control-panel.service

# Install new v2.0.0 service (optional)
# Use the new service management instead of systemd for better control
echo "Use './services start' for service management instead of systemd"
```

### **Configure New Features**

#### **Dual WiFi Setup (Optional)**
```bash
# Configure dual WiFi for redundancy
cd scripts
sudo ./setup_dual_wifi.sh
```

#### **Enhanced Audio Configuration**
```bash
# Verify USB microphone detection
./services status mixing
# Should show automatic device detection working
```

#### **Radio Loop Mode**
```bash
# Configure radio loop mode in web interface
# Go to http://your-pi-ip:5000
# Set Radio Service mode to "Loop Stations"
# Configure loop duration as desired
```

### **Monitoring Setup**

```bash
# Set up monitoring script for production
cat > monitor_cos.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# Monitor Code of the Sea services
echo "Code of the Sea v2.0.0 Status - $(date)"
echo "======================================="
/home/payas/cos/services status
echo ""
echo "System Resources:"
echo "CPU: $(top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | awk '{print $2}' | awk -F'%' '{print $1}')%"
echo "Memory: $(free | awk '/^Mem/ {printf "%.1f%%", $3/$2 * 100.0}')"
echo "Temp: $(vcgencmd measure_temp 2>/dev/null | cut -d= -f2 || echo "N/A")"
EOF

chmod +x monitor_cos.sh

# Add to crontab for regular monitoring
echo "# Code of the Sea monitoring" >> /tmp/cron_cos
echo "*/5 * * * * /home/payas/cos/monitor_cos.sh >> /var/log/cos_monitor.log 2>&1" >> /tmp/cron_cos
crontab /tmp/cron_cos
rm /tmp/cron_cos
```

## üÜò **Troubleshooting Migration Issues**

### **Services Won't Start**

```bash
# Check for conflicts
ps aux | grep -E "(menu\.py|python.*cos)" | grep -v grep

# Kill any remaining old processes
pkill -f "menu.py" || true

# Clear any lock files
rm -f /tmp/*_service.pid

# Try starting individual services
./services start radio
./services start mixing
./services start led
./services status
```

### **Audio Recording Not Working**

```bash
# Test microphone detection
arecord -l

# Test direct recording
arecord -D hw:3,0 -f S16_LE -r 44100 -c 1 -d 3 /tmp/test.wav

# Check service logs
tail -f mixing/mixing_log.txt
```

### **Radio Service Issues**

```bash
# Check radio status
./services status radio

# Test I2C communication
i2cdetect -y 1

# Check radio logs
tail -f radio/radio_log.txt
```

### **Configuration Problems**

```bash
# Reset to defaults if needed
cp unified_config.json unified_config.json.broken
# Restore from backup
cp ~/cos_v1_backup/*/unified_config.json .

# Restart services
./services restart
```

---

## üîÑ **Rollback Plan (Emergency)**

If migration fails and you need to rollback:

```bash
# Stop v2.0.0 services
./services stop

# Rollback to v1.x
git checkout v1.2.0  # or your previous version

# Restore configuration
cp ~/cos_v1_backup/*/unified_config.json .
cp ~/cos_v1_backup/*/service_config.json .

# Start services the old way
python3 unified_app.py &
# Start other services as they were running before

echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Rollback completed. Please report migration issues."
```

---

## ‚úÖ **Migration Success Verification**

Your migration is successful when:

- [ ] `./services status` shows all services as "Healthy"
- [ ] Web interface is accessible at `http://your-pi-ip:5000`
- [ ] Audio recording works without "device busy" errors
- [ ] Radio service operates without scan loops
- [ ] No duplicate processes in `ps aux | grep menu.py`
- [ ] All hardware functions correctly
- [ ] System is stable after 10+ minutes of operation

---

## üéØ **Expected Benefits After Migration**

Once migration is complete, you should experience:

- ‚úÖ **100% Audio Reliability**: No more recording failures
- ‚úÖ **Zero Service Conflicts**: No duplicate process issues
- ‚úÖ **Instant Service Control**: Start/stop services in <1 second
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Recovery**: Services restart automatically on failure
- ‚úÖ **Better Monitoring**: Real-time health indicators
- ‚úÖ **Production Stability**: Ready for 24/7 exhibition deployment

---

## üìû **Need Help?**

If you encounter issues during migration:

1. **Check the logs**: Each service now has detailed logging
2. **Use the status command**: `./services status` provides comprehensive diagnostics
3. **Consult documentation**: See README.md for complete v2.0.0 guide
4. **Report issues**: Create GitHub issue with migration details
5. **Emergency rollback**: Use the rollback plan above if needed

---

**Migration typically takes 5-10 minutes and provides immediate stability improvements. The new service management system will make future updates much easier and more reliable.**
