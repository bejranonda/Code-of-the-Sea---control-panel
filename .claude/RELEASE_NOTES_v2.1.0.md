## üåü What's New in v2.1.0

### Service Persistence System
Building on v2.0's rock-solid service management foundation, v2.1.0 introduces comprehensive persistence that ensures your art installation never misses a beat.

#### ‚úÖ **Automatic Service Restoration**
- Services automatically restart after system reboot, power outage, or unexpected crash
- Zero manual intervention required for exhibition environments
- Maintains exact service states including volume levels, frequencies, and modes

#### ‚úÖ **Dashboard Configuration Persistence**
- User settings, modes, and all configurations persist across restarts
- Dashboard preference (dashboard vs enhanced mode) remembered permanently
- Service-specific settings (lux ranges, volumes, modes) automatically restored

#### ‚úÖ **Exhibition-Grade Reliability**
- Bulletproof operation for 24/7 art installations
- Intelligent state management across all system components
- Seamless recovery from any type of system interruption

### Enhanced Environmental Monitoring

#### ‚úÖ **Extended Lux History (5000 entries)**
- **50x increase** from previous 100-entry limit to 5000 entries
- Comprehensive light monitoring for long-term installations
- Perfect for analyzing environmental patterns over days/weeks

#### ‚úÖ **Smart History Management**
- Automatic file size control with intelligent trimming
- Prevents storage issues while maintaining valuable data
- Configurable thresholds (currently 1MB with 2500-entry safety margin)

#### ‚úÖ **Threshold-Based Recording**
- Only records significant lux changes (>50 lux difference)
- Reduces noise and focuses on meaningful environmental shifts
- Eliminates redundant data while preserving important trends

#### ‚úÖ **Robust LED Service**
- Continues comprehensive lux monitoring even when Tuya LED hardware is unavailable
- No functionality loss during hardware communication issues
- Maintains environmental awareness for other light-reactive services

### System Reliability Improvements

#### ‚úÖ **Enhanced User Experience**
- Default dashboard interface instead of enhanced mode for cleaner presentation
- Streamlined UI for exhibition environments
- Consistent version tracking across all system components

#### ‚úÖ **Storage Architecture**
- Migrated critical state files from temporary (/tmp) to permanent storage
- Prevents data loss during system restarts
- Improved filesystem resilience
